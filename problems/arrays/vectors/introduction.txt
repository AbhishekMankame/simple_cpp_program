## Vectors
<ul>
<li> Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.</li>
<li> Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed in O(N) time.</li>
<li> But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. </li>
